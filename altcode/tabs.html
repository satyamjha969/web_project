        SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases. What is
        SQL? SQL stands for Structured Query Language SQL lets you access and
        manipulate databases SQL became a standard of the American National
        Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization
        for Standardization (ISO) in 1987 What Can SQL do? SQL can execute queries
        against a database SQL can retrieve data from a database SQL can insert
        records in a database SQL can update records in a database SQL can delete
        records from a database SQL can create new databases SQL can create new
        tables in a database SQL can create stored procedures in a database SQL can
        create views in a database SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures,
        and views SQL is a Standard - BUT.... Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard,
        there are different versions of the SQL language. However, to be compliant
        with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such
        as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner. Note: Most of
        the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in
        addition to the SQL standard! Using SQL in Your Web Site To build a web site
        that shows data from a database, you will need: An RDBMS database program
        (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL) To use a server-side scripting language,
        like PHP or ASP To use SQL to get the data you want To use HTML / CSS to
        style the page RDBMS RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.
        RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS
        SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access. The data in RDBMS
        is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of
        related data entries and it consists of columns and rows. Look at the
        "Customers" table:</p>
      <br />
      <br /><br />
      <h3>Example Get your own SQL Server</h3>
      <b> SELECT * FROM Customers; <br /><br /><br /></b>
      <i>Every table is broken up into smaller entities called fields. The fields
        in the Customers table consist of CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName,
        Address, City, PostalCode and Country. A field is a column in a table that
        is designed to maintain specific information about every record in the
        table. A record, also called a row, is each individual entry that exists
        in a table. For example, there are 91 records in the above Customers
        table. A record is a horizontal entity in a table. A column is a vertical
        entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific
        field in a table. ddl commands</i>

        Structured Query Language(SQL) as we all know is the database language by
        the use of which we can perform certain operations on the existing
        database and also we can use this language to create a database. SQL uses
        certain commands like Create, Drop, Insert, etc. to carry out the required
        tasks. These SQL commands are mainly categorized into five categories as:

      <H2> DDL (Data Definition Language):
        <br /><br />
      </H2>
      <p>
        DDL or Data Definition Language actually consists of the SQL commands that
        can be used to define the database schema. It simply deals with descriptions
        of the database schema and is used to create and modify the structure of
        database objects in the database. DDL is a set of SQL commands used to
        create, modify, and delete database structures but not data. These commands
        are normally not used by a general user, who should be accessing the
        database via an application.</p>
      <br /><br />
      List of DDL commands:
      <br /><br />
      CREATE: This command is used to create the database or its objects (like
      table, index, function, views, store procedure, and triggers).
      <br /><br />
      DROP: This command is used to delete objects from the database. <br />
      <br />
      ALTER: This is used to alter the structure of the database. <br />
      <br />
      TRUNCATE: This is used to remove all records from a table, including all
      <br />
      spaces allocated for the records are removed. <br />
      <br />
      COMMENT: This is used to add comments to the data dictionary. <br />
      <br />
      RENAME: This is used to rename an object existing in the database. <br />



      <h2> <br><br> Command-1 :
        CREATE :</h2><br>
      <br><br>
      <p> command is used to create a new table in SQL. The user has to give information like table name, column names,
        and their datatypes.
      </p><br><br>
      Syntax :

        <br> Branch varchar(10)
        <br> );
      </h3>
      <br><br>
      <h2> Command-2 :</h2>
      ALTER : <br><br>
      This command is used to add, delete or change columns in the existing table. The user needs to know the existing
      table name and can do add, delete or modify tasks easily.
      <br><br>
      <h3> Syntax : <br>
      </h3> Syntax to add a column to an existing table.
      <h4></h4> <br><br>
      ALTER TABLE table_name

      <h2>
        DML(Data Manipulation Language):
        <br /><br />
      </h2>
      The SQL commands that deals with the manipulation of data present in the
      database belong to DML or Data Manipulation Language and this includes most
      of the SQL statements. It is the component of the SQL statement that
      controls access to data and to the database. Basically, DCL statements are
      grouped with DML statements.
      <br /><br />
      List of DML commands:
      <br /><br />

      INSERT : It is used to insert data into a table. <br />
      <br />
      UPDATE: It is used to update existing data within a table. <br />
      <br />
      DELETE : It is used to delete records from a database table. <br />
      <br />
      LOCK: Table control concurrency. <br />
      <br />
      CALL: Call a PL/SQL or JAVA subprogram. <br />
      <br />



      <br><br>
      <H2> SELECT DML Command
      </H2>
      <p> <br>
        SELECT is the most important data manipulation command in Structured Query Language. The SELECT command shows
        the records of the specified table. It also shows the particular record of a particular column by using the
        WHERE clause.
      <h3><br>

        Syntax of SELECT DML command
      </h3><br>
      SELECT column_Name_1, column_Name_2, ….., column_Name_N FROM Name_of_table;
      <br><br>
      Here, column_Name_1, column_Name_2, ….., column_Name_N are the names of those columns whose data we want to
      retrieve from the table.

      If we want to retrieve the data from all the columns of the table, we have to use the following SELECT command:
      <br><br>
      <h3>
        SELECT * FROM table_name;
        <br>
        <br> Examples of SELECT Command
      </h3>
      <h2>
        Example 1: This example shows all the values of every column from the table.
        <br>
      </h2>
      <h3> SELECT * FROM Student;
        <br>
      </h3><br>

      <h2><br>
        INSERT DML Command
      </h2><br><br>
      INSERT is another most important data manipulation command in Structured Query Language, which allows users to
      insert data in database tables.
      <br>
      Syntax of INSERT Command
      <br>
      <h3>
        INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME ( column_Name1 , column_Name2 , column_Name3 , .... column_NameN ) VALUES (value_1,
        value_2, value_3, .... value_N ) ;
        <br><br>
      </h3>
      Examples of INSERT Command
      <h4>
        Example 1: This example describes how to insert the record in the database table.
      </h4><br><br>
      Let's take the following student table, which consists of only 2 records of the student. <br>
      Stu_Id Stu_Name Stu_Marks Stu_Age <br>
      101 Ramesh 92 20 <br>
      201 Jatin 83 19 <br>
      <br><br>
      Suppose, you want to insert a new record into the student table. For this, you have to write the following DML
      INSERT command:
      <br><br>
      <h3>
        INSERT INTO Student (Stu_id, Stu_Name, Stu_Marks, Stu_Age) VALUES (104, Anmol, 89, 19);
      </h3>
      <h2><br>
        UPDATE DML Command
      </h2><br><br>
      UPDATE is another most important data manipulation command in Structured Query Language, which allows users to
      update or modify the existing data in database tables.
      <br>
      Syntax of UPDATE Command
      <br>
      <h4>
        UPDATE Table_name SET [column_name1= value_1, ….., column_nameN = value_N] WHERE CONDITION;
      </h4>
      Here, 'UPDATE', 'SET', and 'WHERE' are the SQL keywords, and 'Table_name' is the name of the table whose values
      you want to update.
      <br>
      <h4> Examples of the UPDATE command
      </h4><br>
      Example 1: This example describes how to update the value of a single field.
      <br>
      Let's take a Product table consisting of the following records: <br> <br>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>product_id</th>

          <th>

            Product_Name </th>
          <th> Product_Price </th>
          <th> Product_Quantity </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>p00</td>
          <td> redbull</td>
          <td> Chips</td>
          <td> 20
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> P102 </td>
            <td>monster</td>
            <td> 60</td>
            <td> 40 </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> p10 </td>
          <td>cookie</td>
          <td> 75</td>
          <td>5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> P201 </td>
          <td>snacks</td>
          <td> 80</td>
          <td>10
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> p20 </td>
          <td>rusk</td>
          <td> 40 </td>
          <td>2
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <br><br>
      Suppose, you want to update the Product_Price of the product whose Product_Id is P102. To do this, you have to
      write the following DML UPDATE command:
      <br>
      <h3> UPDATE Product SET Product_Price = 80 WHERE Product_Id = 'P102' ;
      </h3><br><br>

      <h2> DQL (Data Query Language):
        <br />
      </h2>
      <br />
      DQL statements are used for performing queries on the data within schema
      objects. The purpose of the DQL Command is to get some schema relation based
      on the query passed to it. We can define DQL as follows it is a component of
      SQL statement that allows getting data from the database and imposing order
      upon it. It includes the SELECT statement. This command allows getting the
      data out of the database to perform operations with it. When a SELECT is
      fired against a table or tables the result is compiled into a further
      temporary table, which is displayed or perhaps received by the program i.e.
      a front-end.
      <br />
      <br />
      List of DQL:
      <br /><br />
      SELECT: It is used to retrieve data from the database.
      <br /><br />

      EXPLAIN PLAN: It describes the access path to data. <br /><br />
      DCL (Data Control Language):
      <br /><br />
      DCL includes commands such as GRANT and REVOKE which mainly deal with the
      rights, permissions, and other controls of the database system.
      <br /><br />
      List of DCL commands:
      <br />
      <br />
      GRANT: This command gives users access privileges to the database. <br />
      <br />
      REVOKE: This command withdraws the user's access privileges given by using
      the GRANT command. <br /><br />

        TCL (Transaction Control Language):
        <br />
      </h2>
      <br />
      Transactions group a set of tasks into a single execution unit. Each
      transaction begins with a specific task and ends when all the tasks in the
      group successfully complete. If any of the tasks fail, the transaction
      fails. Therefore, a transaction has only two results: success or failure.
      You can explore more about transactions here. Hence, the following TCL
      commands are used to control the execution of a transaction:
      <br />
      <br />
      BEGIN: Opens a Transaction. <br />
      <br />
      COMMIT: Commits a Transaction. <br />
      <br />
      ROLLBACK: Rollbacks a transaction in case of any error occurs. <br />
      <br />
      SAVEPOINT: Sets a save point within a transaction. <br />
      <br />
      SET TRANSACTION: Specifies characteristics for the transaction.
